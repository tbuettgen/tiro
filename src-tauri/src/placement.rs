//! Multi-monitor window placement, ported from the original's Win32 layer
//! (`_active_work_area` / `_place_window` / `_reposition_burst` /
//! `_summon_front`, WIN32-1):
//!
//! - windows land on the ACTIVE monitor's work area, not always the primary:
//!   the monitor under the cursor, falling back to the panel's monitor, then
//!   the primary (the original preferred the foreground window's monitor — a
//!   Win32-only signal; the cursor is its own documented fallback and the
//!   portable equivalent)
//! - pill: centered horizontally, docked to the top or bottom work-area edge
//!   per `pill_position` / `pill_padding` (default: bottom, 110 px up — the
//!   original's fixed spot, so untouched configs behave exactly as before)
//! - panel: reappears at its REMEMBERED position — the spot the user last
//!   left it, tracked live while visible, captured again right before a
//!   hide, and persisted in config (`panel_pos`, "x,y") so it survives
//!   restarts. Centering (nudged mh/16 below dead-center) happens only when
//!   there is no remembered position yet or the remembered one is off every
//!   current monitor (unplugged screen / changed layout). This deliberately
//!   replaces the original's "center until first drag" behavior.
//! - summon raises the panel over the active window via a TOPMOST->NOTOPMOST
//!   flip (permanent only when pinned) and focuses it
//!
//! All window ops are proxied to the main thread (GTK requirement); math is
//! in physical pixels like the original.
